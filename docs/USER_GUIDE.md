## üèõÔ∏è Certificate Authority

### Understanding the CA

The Certificate Authority (CA) is the root of trust for all certificates issued by CertA. Installing the root CA certificate in your system's trusted store makes all CertA-issued certificates trusted.

   - Navigate to "Certificate Authority" in the main menu
   - View CA information and download options

2. **CA Information Displayed**
   - **Name**: CA name and organization
   - **Common Name**: CA certificate common name
   - **Organization**: CA organization details
   - **Location**: Country, state, and locality
   - **Created Date**: When the CA was created
   - **Expiry Date**: When the CA expires (typically 10 years)
   - **Status**: Whether the CA is active

### Installing the Root CA

#### Windows

1. **Download CA Certificate**
   - Click "Root CA Certificate (PEM)" on the CA page

   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   # Check if certificate is installed
   openssl verify -CAfile /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/CertA_Root_CA.pem your_certificate.pem
   ```
